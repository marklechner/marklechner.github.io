I'm a senior technology leader with over 15 years of experience spanning cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and digital transformation. Originally from Hungary, my journey took me to Canada where I spent 9 years building my career before settling in Germany in 2020.

I'm interested and experienced in building and scaling robust security cultures while enabling business growth. Throughout my career, I've focused on transforming traditional infrastructure into cloud-native environments, implementing zero-trust security frameworks, and fostering "you build it, you own it" operational models that empower engineering teams.

Recently, I've been exploring the intersection of open source security tools and Large Language Models. I'm particularly excited about leveraging AI to enhance security operations and democratize advanced security capabilities. If you have time/interest please have a look at the two recent tools presented in the projects section of this homepage and feel free to comment, contribute or simply try them out.
