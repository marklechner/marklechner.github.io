    <p>I&rsquo;m a senior technology leader with over 15 years of experience spanning cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and digital transformation. Originally from Hungary, my journey took me to Canada where I spent 9 years building my career before settling in Germany in 2020.</p>
<p>Currently serving as CISO at DeepOpinion, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of leading global teams and driving security initiatives at organizations like Bitpanda, Solaris Bank, and Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested and experienced in building and scaling robust security cultures while enabling business growth. Throughout my career, I&rsquo;ve focused on transforming traditional infrastructure into cloud-native environments, implementing zero-trust security frameworks, and fostering &ldquo;you build it, you own it&rdquo; operational models that empower engineering teams.</p>
<p>With a background that began in database administration and evolved through security engineering to executive leadership, I bring both technical depth and strategic vision to cybersecurity challenges.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been exploring the intersection of open source security tools and Large Language Models. I&rsquo;m particularly excited about leveraging AI to enhance security operations and democratize advanced security capabilities. If you have time/interest please have a look at the two recent tools presented in the projects section of this homepage and feel free to comment, contribute or simply try them out.</p>
