      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a senior technology leader with over 15 years of experience spanning cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and digital transformation. Originally from Hungary, my journey took me to Canada where I spent 9 years building my career before settling in Germany in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently serving as CISO at DeepOpinion, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the privilege of leading global teams and driving security initiatives at organizations like Bitpanda, Solaris Bank, and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m interested and experienced in building and scaling robust security cultures while enabling business growth. Throughout my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve focused on transforming traditional infrastructure into cloud-native environments, implementing zero-trust security frameworks, and fostering &amp;ldquo;you build it, you own it&amp;rdquo; operational models that empower engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
