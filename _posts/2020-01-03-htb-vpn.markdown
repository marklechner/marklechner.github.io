## Enable and set up ssh
* With Kali running on virtualbox you can now download the VPN connection pack via https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/htb/access/ovpnfile
* I downloaded it via my host and then used scp to make it available on Kali: `scp myuser.ovpn root@192.168.56.4:/root/Desktop/HTB/`
* Once there I used the following command on Kali which has openvpn preinstalled to connect to HTB lab environment: `openvpn myuser.ovpn
* Now one can see the hosts available via https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines
